## About

Soulbound is a solo project I've been working on for some time. It began as a way for me to improve my C# skills, but over time, it has grown into something I consistently return to. Now, I’m at the point where I’d like to release a demo build of the game for people to try and receive feedback on.

The main gameplay loop involves the player taking on various challenges in the fragmented world. Each level is unique and offers varying degrees of difficulty depending on the player’s progress.

Movement is intended to be the main appeal of the game, with numerous variables that influence how the player can navigate each level in a fun and engaging way.

I will be adding more sections soon to showcase specific mechanics when I get time.
